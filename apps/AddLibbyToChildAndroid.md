You can't easily approve Libby library audiobook app on child-managed Android Tablet, as the app is rated T and the default is a lower level.

Instead, add libbyapp.com to the list of kids websites they can visit in Chrome browser. Then make a shortcut from the home screen.
Downside: can't download books, can't play with screen off, and can't zoom some books.
