We have so much online metadata, an algorithm could use that in some privacy-preserving way to help you meet other nerds with similar interests. 

e.g. You share some of your youtube subscriptions with this app, and then it looks for other users you might want to have a physical/digital friendship with

Possible data sources:
- Youtube / TikTok / Instagram / Twitter accounts subscribed/followed
	- Also, like/comments/view history on any social media above
	- Also, subreddits
- Having an account on specialized social media: Letterboxd, Strava, GitHub
	- Export the hostnames from your password manager?

Would also be very interesting to try using this matching algorithm for your existing friends, and discover unknown common interests.
