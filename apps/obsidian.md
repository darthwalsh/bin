Markdown editor with great community extensions for PKM.

## special upgrade
Autoupdates, but sometimes a new version (that upgrades electron?) will show:
>major installer update: manually download and reinstall Obsidian

But I installed through [[brew]] so I wasn't going to click their link. Fix:
```
brew reinstall obsidian
```
(this is a good time to upgrade [[obsidian.plugins]] too!)

## upgrade features to try
- [ ] - Outline now has an "Auto-scroll to current section" option.
## Sub-notes:
- [[obsidian.archive]]
- [[obsidian.keybindings]]
- [[obsidian.plugins]]
- [[obsidian.plugin.dev]]


- [ ] *how to generate this automatically?*
