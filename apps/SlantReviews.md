I really liked https://slant.co for detailed reviews of app suggestions for solving various problem.
It was great to see the upvotes, but then also look through top cons for major limitations.

## 2024 update

>Sorry, Slant is going read-only to preserve the content, sign ups are no longer allowed

Too bad, it has been "archived" and can't be improved further.
I guess it never got too popular: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slant.co `404`'s
https://x.com/SlantCo now points to the team's next product

## Replacement for physical products
Only really for physical products, but https://www.looria.com/about is pretty neat

### 2025 update

Problem/context: I want a tiny Slant-style evaluator for my own tool picks: single expert user/operator, transparent, minimal state, no one-number scores—just the top risks and fit notes.

Global signals (universally good):
- Recent commits/releases or clear “stable/done” posture
- PR/issue responsiveness and merge follow-through
- License clarity and permissiveness
- Contributor spread (bus factor) and avoided abandonment

Personal taste (editable defaults):
- Optimized for one user who builds and operates
- Prefer CLI/text, explicit config, and debuggability over polish
- Minimize persistence; justify any database/queue
- Separate objective risk notes from taste-driven preferences
