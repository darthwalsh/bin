### [Button for Google Calendar - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/button-for-google-calenda/lfjnmopldodmmdhddmeacgjnjeakjpki)

Now the extension has been forked by a few groups, including one which advertises Manganum extension.
Considering forking myself to remove ads, or maybe trying [Checker Plus for Google Calendar™ - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/checker-plus-for-google-c/hkhggnncdpfibdhinjiegagmopldibha)
