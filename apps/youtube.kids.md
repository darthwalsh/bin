There are two main "Kids" interfaces for youtube: https://www.youtube.com/myfamily/
## Real Youtube from a Child profile: Age 9+
1. Create a Child google account in your Google Family
2. Choose content setting by age, starting at 9+
3. Block content using Family Link app
4. See "kid-safe" ads
## Youtube Kids from Adult profile: Age 0-8
1. Using your adult gmail, create a Kids profile
2. Choose **Approve content yourself**: opt-in specific channels, playlists, or videos (no search)
3. Kid can only play (or download for offline!) exactly what I picked
4. Uses a [different toddler-friendly app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.kids&hl=en_US) to watch

I feel a lot better stepping away from my phone for 2 minutes if it's open to this restricted YouTube Kids app -- i would be worried if they were on the real youtube app that they might tap-tap to something weird.
