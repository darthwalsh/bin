## New machine setup
1. https://docs.brew.sh/Installation
2. Run `brew bundle` in the same folder as `Brewfile`
  - *ensure it is not downloaded as `.TXT` by github!*

## Autoupdate in the background

- Run `brew autoupdate start --upgrade --immediate`
  * Upgrades all packages every 24 hours
  * https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#autoupdate-subcommand-interval-options
  * Can view the config file: `less ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.domt4.homebrew-autoupdate.plist`
* Ensure homebrew-updater has Notification permission in System Preferences
* Don't wait during interactive shell sessions for updates
  * `export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1`

## Cleanup
- Don't need to clean up manually, just don't change default:
  * `brew cleanup` will run automatically every 30 days
* Auto-Remove dependencies that are not long needed after running `brew autoremove`
  * Now the default, will run automatically every cleanup and uninstall
  * Before [brew 4.3.0](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/tag/4.3.0) needed to opt-in by setting `export HOMEBREW_AUTOREMOVE=1`
* Removing taps
  * I documented my workaround here: https://superuser.com/questions/1778642/how-to-untap-all-unused-brew-taps
  * Don't feel like I have a good answer yet, because it's good to untap `cask` but bad to untap `bundle`...

## Getting the list of which packages are installed
[[brew.listpackages]]

## Alternatives
I was considering moving to [`tea`/`pkgx`](tea.md).

Cool features:

- symlink `jq -> tea` and it would automagically download then run i.e. `jq` on-demand
- setting up zsh shell's (or pwsh?) command-not-found function to install from tea

...but brew seems much more stable for now.
