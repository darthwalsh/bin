I've been using [[IFTTT]] for a while to copy my Strava activities to google calendar. Some other items I might want tracked:
- [ ] [[VideoGameTimeTracking]]
- [ ] [[RescueTime]]
- [ ] Google Fit
- [ ] Goodreads book activity
- [ ] Music/Audiobooks/Podcast
- [ ] Microsoft To Do entries

Definitely use a new calendar for this, so any changes the tool makes are isolated from your primary calendar!
## Write back support
Would it work to edit the event time (or description?!), and the sync tool makes the edit back at the source?
