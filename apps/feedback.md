I personally enjoy giving suggestions on apps that I regularly use. It can be a way to contribute to OSS projects, but given the potential suggestion volume [[FossUserVoice|GitHub Issues isn't a great way to collect it]].
## Google Feedback
You can view your own reports at https://www.google.com/tools/feedback/reports

When I worked at Google, I could search the internal bug tracker and see my reports. Sometimes the report seemed to automatically create an issue in the product team's bug tracker (which hopefully the product team was working on, which wasn't a given?) but other reports seemed to go into the void.
## Microsoft Office
For a while, Microsoft 365 apps would submit feedback using a nice integration to [[UserVoice]]. They had a cool voting mode, showing you a couple issues and saying "which would you upvote?" IIRC it changed to a custom Microsoft feedback system.
## Microsoft Feedback Portal
i.e. https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/ad198462-1c1c-ec11-b6e7-0022481f8472
- [ ] When posting issue, the "similar feedback" shows the most exact match, even though there might be several duplicates. But doesn't show the top-voted!
## UserVoice
Some other apps were using [[UserVoice]], but [it's really expensive](https://www.uservoice.com/pricing), starting at $899 a month.
