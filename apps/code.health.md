## Coupling
From https://wasabigeek.com/blog/coupling-and-cohesion-is-a-tradeoff/
People often talk about code coupling like it's an absolute, but [this talk](https://youtu.be/3gib0hKYjB0?t=545) talks about how coupling is "always with respect to a particular change."

>This formulation suggests we stop treating coupling as something that is strictly intrinsic to our code. Rather, we consciously (or sub-consciously) make coupling tradeoffs when choosing how to modularize our code.
