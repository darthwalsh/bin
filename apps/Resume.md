Features I probably want:
- hide private fields: phone number

- [ ] Try JSON import
- [ ] Try viewing resume.json in YAML
- [ ] Try converting my DOCX to Markdown

## Markdown option
- Uses `pandoc`
- https://luther.io/markdown-resume/
  - example: https://luther.io/vidluther-resume
  - source: https://github.com/vidluther/markdown-resume/blob/main/resume.md?plain=1
- luther's was sourced from: https://sdsawtelle.github.io/blog/output/simple-markdown-resume-with-pandoc-and-wkhtmltopdf.html
  - example: https://sdsawtelle.github.io/resume.html
  - source: https://sdsawtelle.github.io/attachments/resume.md

My verdict: compared to `resume.json` it would need serious CSS to get comparable output.
Markdown seems easier to maintain than JSON, but I'm hoping that YAML won't be hard

	- > You canÂ **merge multiple resumes together**Â by specifying them in order from most generic to most specific: `hackmyresume build base.json specific.json TO resume.all`
	- > This can be useful for overriding a base (generic) resume with information from a specific (targeted) resume. For example, you might override your generic catch-all "software developer" resume with specific details from your targeted "game developer" resume, or combine two partial resumes into a "complete" resume. Merging follows conventionalÂ [extend()](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/)-style behavior...
	- > **Private Resume Fields**: Have a gig, education stint, membership, or other relevant history that you'd like to hide fromÂ _most_Â (e.g. public) resumes but sometimes show on others? Tag it withÂ `"private": true`Â to omit it from outbound generated resumes by default.
	- > Then, when you want a copy of your resume that includes the private gig / stint / etc., tell HackMyResume that it's OK to emit private fields. The way you do that is with the --private switch.
