	- > You canÂ **merge multiple resumes together**Â by specifying them in order from most generic to most specific: `hackmyresume build base.json specific.json TO resume.all`
	- > This can be useful for overriding a base (generic) resume with information from a specific (targeted) resume. For example, you might override your generic catch-all "software developer" resume with specific details from your targeted "game developer" resume, or combine two partial resumes into a "complete" resume. Merging follows conventionalÂ [extend()](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/)-style behavior...
	- > **Private Resume Fields**: Have a gig, education stint, membership, or other relevant history that you'd like to hide fromÂ _most_Â (e.g. public) resumes but sometimes show on others? Tag it withÂ `"private": true`Â to omit it from outbound generated resumes by default.
	- > Then, when you want a copy of your resume that includes the private gig / stint / etc., tell HackMyResume that it's OK to emit private fields. The way you do that is with the --private switch.
