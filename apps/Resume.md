Features I probably want:
- hide private fields: phone number

- [x] Try converting my DOCX to Markdown
- [ ] Try JSON import
- [ ] Try viewing resume.json in YAML

## Markdown option
- Uses `pandoc` to generate
- https://luther.io/markdown-resume/
  - example: https://luther.io/vidluther-resume
  - source: https://github.com/vidluther/markdown-resume/blob/main/resume.md?plain=1
- luther's was sourced from: https://sdsawtelle.github.io/blog/output/simple-markdown-resume-with-pandoc-and-wkhtmltopdf.html
  - example: https://sdsawtelle.github.io/resume.html
  - source: https://sdsawtelle.github.io/attachments/resume.md

#### Getting started with Markdown
You can take your existing DOCX and generate a starting MD file:
`pandoc YourResume.docx -t gfm+hard_line_breaks -o resume.md`

Then you can generate HTML by running:
`pandoc resume.md -o resume.html`

#### My verdict
Compared to `resume.json` it would need serious CSS to get comparable output.
Markdown seems easier to maintain than JSON, but I'm hoping that YAML won't be hard.

## `resume.json` ðŸŒŸ**4k**
Example: https://registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis
Source: https://gist.github.com/thomasdavis/c9dcfa1b37dec07fb2ee7f36d7278105
Site https://jsonresume.org/
CLI: https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli run `resume export resume.pdf`

Various themes: https://jsonresume.org/themes/
* https://github.com/thibaudcolas/jsonresume-theme-eloquent
	* Obfuscates your email address and phone number from spam bots.

My favorite theme so far: spartacus https://registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis?theme=spartacus

#### resumed CLI

Tried `npx resumed render ~\OneDrive\Employment\Resume\resume.json --theme jsonresume-theme-even -o resume-even.html`

- [ ] Might use resume-cli instead of resumed instead though?

#### Import from LinkedIn
> One of our community members wrote a great Chrome extension to import your LinkedIn Profile. [Download here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-resume-exporter/caobgmmcpklomkcckaenhjlokpmfbdec)

#### Hosting
1. create a Gist on GitHub namedÂ `resume.json`.
2. Our hosting service will automatically detect this when you accessÂ `https://registry.jsonresume.org/{your_github_username}`
*Use your own repository (instead of a gist)*

Schema: https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema

> You canÂ **merge multiple resumes together**Â by specifying them in order from most generic to most specific: `hackmyresume build base.json specific.json TO resume.all`
> This can be useful for overriding a base (generic) resume with information from a specific (targeted) resume. For example, you might override your generic catch-all "software developer" resume with specific details from your targeted "game developer" resume, or combine two partial resumes into a "complete" resume. Merging follows conventionalÂ [extend()](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/)-style behavior...
> **Private Resume Fields**: Have a gig, education stint, membership, or other relevant history that you'd like to hide fromÂ _most_Â (e.g. public) resumes but sometimes show on others? Tag it withÂ `"private": true`Â to omit it from outbound generated resumes by default.
> Then, when you want a copy of your resume that includes the private gig / stint / etc., tell HackMyResume that it's OK to emit private fields. The way you do that is with the --private switch.
