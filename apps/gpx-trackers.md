I normally use [Strava app](https://www.strava.com/mobile) and [export GPX files](../gpx.py) from the website.

[OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) with Trip Recording plugin lets you create GPX tracks.
Overall, this app feels quite complicated.

Another open-source one I haven't tried is [Î¼logger](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/ulogger-android) with a self-hosted web server.
