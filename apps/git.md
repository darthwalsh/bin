## Don't lose uncommitted work
Any changes you commit in git are always always possible to recover. But any changes you revert or hard-reset over are probably gone for good. Like `rm` with [[SystemTrash#Try rmtrash|rmtrash]], there's a tool that makes periodic backups. (This is like google's google3 which had "open your workspace N minutes ago" virtual paths to solve the same problem.)
