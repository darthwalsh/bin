I've liked the idea of Shortform: there are a lot of business/nonfiction books out there where if you could just internalize 5% of the core, you could skip 95% of the exposition

It helps to see what else is out there to know how these compare:
- **Blinkist**: Probably the best known of these types. Very short summaries ("blinks"), mostly for nonfiction, many users like its simplicity. Short on depth compared to Shortform.
- **Instaread**: Similar to Blinkist in many ways: fast takeaways, both audio & text, less depth.
- **Headway**: More visual, more bite-sized, sometimes gamified.
- **getAbstract**: More professional / corporate, heavy focus on business & leadership, lots of reports, etc.
