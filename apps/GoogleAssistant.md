## "Downloads"
Plays Youtube Music Download. 
Setup using Google Assistant > Shortcuts > Youtube Music > Downloads > Press +

Works talking to Android or Pixel Buds

### Couldn't get a specific playlist to play
Tried creating Assistant Automation "Tunes" to Play Music > "Replay mix" but this either
- Opened Replay Mix from Library, not Downloads, so it wasn't able to play on mobile data off wifi
- OR, it just "encountered an error" and refused to do anything
- [x] Deleted

## "Audiobook"
Opens Libby currently playing
Setup using Google Assistant > Shortcuts > Libby > *Whatever is currently playing*

Downsides:
- From Pixel Buds, replies "Sorry that shortcut will only work on an android phone with that app installed" but it *does* work and opens Libby app.
- It opens Libby, but doesn't start playing the audiobook hands-free, so I'm not sure this is much better than jus

## "Audible"
Opens Audible currently playing.
Same as Libby, doesn't actually playing the audio.

## Device "Hey Google" sensitivity
When you are in range of your phone, it can be annoying when Google Home speaker instead responds.
- [x] Manually set its sensitivity in the Assistant Settings to `-1`
