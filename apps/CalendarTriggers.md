>  Install the Calendar Event Triggers service. This service allows you to trigger functions based on calendar events. Go to Extensions > Manage Add-ons and search for "Calendar Event Triggers". Install it and enable it for your project.
>  * Create triggers for your functions. Go to Edit > Current project's triggers. Click on Add trigger and set the following:
>  * Function: Choose the function you want to trigger (e.g., onCalendarEventStart).
>  * Event type: Select from Calendar.
>  * Event source: Choose All calendars.
>  * Event name: Select When an event starts.

Now, whenever a calendar event starts or ends, the corresponding function will be triggered.
