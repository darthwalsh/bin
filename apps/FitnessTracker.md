## Withings Steel HR
*Withings was owned by Nokia for a while*
From maybe 2018-2021
Then again 2024-present

### Notifications
Currently buzzing on phone calls, WhatsApp, and [[GoogleTasks]]
### "Smart" Alarm doesn't work
I set an alarm for 10AM, with Smart Wakeup for an hour earlier.

First, if the fitness tracker sees I wake up at 8AM and take dozens of steps, a smart alarm would skip buzzing. But Withings always triggers needlessly. It might be possible to automate a fix, if I had [[#Automating sleep events]].

Second, the Smart Wakeup is supposed to buzz sometime between 9-10 based on when I'm sleeping most lightly. But as far as I can tell, it always fires right at 9AM. [Others report the same thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/withings/comments/107fzm6/withings_smart_wake_alarm_does_not_work/).
### Automating sleep events
Unsupported for Withings watch to fire sleep tracker events:? https://ifttt.com/WithingsSleep

Would be nice for when my smartwatch says I'm asleep, then it fires an event and Tasker pauses my phone podcast and rewinds it a fixed amount. (Related: [[FamilyPause]])
### Can't manually add sleep/naps
There's no way from the app to add a sleep if it didn't track anything. And they removed nap detection when they made other sleep tracking "improvements"...
Can't import from Google Fit, but can export *to* Google Fit and can manually add sleep in Fit so maybe that should be the source of truth?

## Microsoft Band 2
For a few years around 2015
## Google Fit on Android Phone
A lot less useful after the shut down the website...
## Gyroscope
[Gyroscope | Your all-in-one Health Coach](https://gyrosco.pe/)
Wasn't super useful to me, because it was syncing [[LocationHistory]] from iPhone App or other services, not google timeline. I liked the age as floating point where the 9th decimal consistenly went up.
For a while, https://me.carlwa.com/ went to my personal dashboard, but https://gyrosco.pe/carlwalsh/ is pretty empty now...
IIRC had the browser extension as a custom home page too.

Looks like they pivoted business models now.

Alternatively, #app-idea `created: 2018-01-13` to sync from Google fit, and say how many donuts you earned. IIRC [[#Gyroscope]] would do exactly this, letting you share your runs in cookies / slices of pizza / etc...
