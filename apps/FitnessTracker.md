### Notifications
Currently buzzing on phone calls, WhatsApp, and [[GoogleTasks]]
### "Smart" Alarm doesn't work
I set an alarm for 10AM, with Smart Wakeup for an hour earlier.

First, if the fitness tracker sees I wake up at 8AM and take dozens of steps, a smart alarm would skip buzzing. But Withings always triggers needlessly. It might be possible to automate a fix, but would need the sleep tracker which can fire events: https://ifttt.com/WithingsSleep

Second, the Smart Wakeup is supposed to buzz sometime between 9-10 based on when I'm sleeping most lightly. But as far as I can tell, it always fires right at 9AM. [Others report the same thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/withings/comments/107fzm6/withings_smart_wake_alarm_does_not_work/).
