- [ ] git commit fail on `TODO |TODONT` text being added? Could I make this a global pre commit hook? 
- [ ] Would I be able to stop running `gitodo.ps1`?
	- [ ] That has special logic to check files not staged, but precommit hook makes that simpler

## Existing tools
- [x] search google for prior art
https://github.com/pimterry/git-confirm has bash script runs local `grep`, and interactively prompt when pattern matches
- [x] NEXT, claims it works in powershell but try it on #windows  -- not sure how that's possible outside WSL, using regular bash üîº

```command
$ git config --add hooks.confirm.match "TODO "  
$ git config --add hooks.confirm.match "TODONT"  
$ git config --get-all hooks.confirm.match  
TODO  
TODONT
```

- [ ] Check this doesn't hang vscode git commit on prompt

### Git-for-Windows has special logic to run `git-bash` on hooks
Just start hook with `#!/bin/sh`
See https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1420#issuecomment-355433179

- [-] kind of old project, should be simple to recreate xplat, like a powershell version of ‚ùå 2024-10-22

## Global git hook, that doesn't break local pre-commit
It would be nice to have a global git hook to run this on all repos, [i.e. this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37293198/771768):

```command
git config --global core.hooksPath /path/to/my/centralized/hooks
```
BUT!
>setting a global hooks path disables all local hooks in your repos!

- [ ] Simple example: create run-local-hook global script like https://stackoverflow.com/a/71939092/771768 #macbook ‚è´
- [ ] fallback, maybe local git config of core.hooksPath ignores this on pre-commit repos
