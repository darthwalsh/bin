### Plugins I'm using
- https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban
- https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner
    - Reorder bullets / sub-bullets with hotkeys
- https://github.com/shichongrui/obsidian-reveal-active-file
    - Make obsidian act more like how I use vscode
- https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks
    - [Queries](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/About+Queries) with ```` ```task````
    - Can add `explain` to query to get English breakdown
    - Problem: setting custom status using right click [only works](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Editing/Toggling+and+Editing+Statuses#'Change+task+status'+context+menu) in Reading mode (not Live Preview)
    - *Not part of tasks*, but if you just want the builtin search plugin can use ```` ```query````
    - [ ] Would be nice to have a hotkey to increase the priority: normal -> medium -> high using the emojis. Maybe with [JS script](https://github.com/eoureo/obsidian-runjs) or [[obsidian.plugin.dev#Light scripting]] or i can fork/create plugin to add the commands?? üîº 
    - [ ] https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/On+Completion#Supported+actions try using checkered flag emoji signifier for delete on recurring?

        - Query: sync archived
        - folder: MyNotes/Omnivore/{{{date}}}
        - Article template: add `{{{ content }}}` to the end
    - [ ] #windows  Doesn't seem to be syncing the "Article Notes" i.e. [this](https://omnivore.app/me/mkdocs-linkcheck-py-pi-19230563b36) ‚è´ 
    - [ ] Try removing date in folder
    - [ ] Try configuring this folder to open read-only

    - [ ] set up auto sync
- https://github.com/kemayo/obsidian-smart-links
    - Need to press CMD+E to "Toggle Reading Mode" -- known limitation that it doesn't work in edit mode,  https://github.com/kemayo/obsidian-smart-links/issues/1
- https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch
    - smarter search ordering, instead of the builtin-search order by-timestamp or by-filename

    - One-tap access from android home-screen to current daily note by opening URL `obsidian://log`
    - Configured:
        - prefix: ""
        - timestamp: false
        - always-new-pane: false
        - inbox: inbox

		- >Daily Notes: New `daily` Obsidian URI action to automatically open or create your daily note.
### Stopped using
- https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-obsidian
    - Now in maintenance mode
    - Can use obsidian android app to share links or write short noteskemayo/obsidian-smart-links/issues/1
- https://github.com/marc0l92/obsidian-jira-issue
    - Felt kind of clunky
    - I often paste in the full JIRA url
    - I have terminal scripts / browser shortcuts to open JIRA issues
- https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git
	- Stopped because I wanted SSH auth, which isn't supported in mobile JS host
	- Can still view https://github.com/darthwalsh/bin markdown directly
	- [ ] But should be feasible to set up in-vault access using HTTPS and PAT? Test if the git folder plugin would support reading into a parallel subfolder that is ignored by OneDrive? Probably easiest to test first on desktop üîº 
- [-] Was considering writing [PWA that can write files](https://whatpwacando.today/file-system/) into `inbox/` that could receive natives shares? Would shows some toast/notification to let you edit the markdown file?
