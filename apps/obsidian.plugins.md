### App Ideas

#### Tabbing through all hierarchies
#app-idea 
For [[hierarchies]], let you TAB/UNTAB through multiple layers, up from subbullets, to bullets, un-bulleted text, headings, and eventually new files.
i.e. if you TAB-TAB-TAB-indent on some text that is an H4, it would first become plain (un-bulletted) text, then top-level bullet. And the opposite: if you UNTAB-UNTAB-UNTAB-dedent a top-level bullet to be like a H6 or whatever the configured-lowest level is for the document is.
If you keep untabbing, could it become a separate file? 
If so, you could select multiple files in a foldr, and tab, and they each become H1 in one file?
Maybe it could just error out is trying to do something unsupported like create multiple files? Or is the obsidian heading hierarchy doesn't quite line up. This is just unsupported? 
Would be like a proof of concept for my earlier plug-in idea

(Confluence wiki seems to support this untabbing )

## ❌ Tried / Stopped Using
- [Omnivore](https://github.com/omnivore-app/obsidian-omnivore)
    - Config: 
        - Query: sync archived: `in:archive`
        - folder: `MyNotes/Omnivore/{{{date}}}`
        - Article template: add `{{{ content }}}` to the end, `{{{note}}}` to start
    - Doesn't seem to be syncing the "Article Notes" i.e. [this](https://omnivore.app/me/mkdocs-linkcheck-py-pi-19230563b36) ⏫
        - [x] Fixed by adding `{{{note}}}` to template (*separate* from `#highlights .note`) [docs](https://docs.omnivore.app/integrations/obsidian.html#sync-all-the-items-into-a-single-note)
    - [-] Try removing date in folder ❌ 2024-10-31
    - [-] Try configuring this folder to open read-only ❌ 2024-10-31
    - [-] Try some tool to embed the highlights, query whether "inbox" is handled, and to create tasks? ❌ 2024-10-31
    - [-] set up auto sync ❌ 2024-10-31
- [Fleeting Notes](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-obsidian)
    - Now in maintenance mode
    - Can use obsidian android app to share links or write short noteskemayo/obsidian-smart-links/issues/1
- [Jira Issue](https://github.com/marc0l92/obsidian-jira-issue)
    - Felt kind of clunky
    - I often paste in the full JIRA url
    - I have terminal scripts / browser shortcuts to open JIRA issues
- [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git)
    - Stopped because I wanted SSH auth, which isn't supported in mobile JS host
    - Can still view https://github.com/darthwalsh/bin markdown directly
    - [ ] But should be feasible to set up in-vault access using HTTPS and PAT? Test if the git folder plugin would support reading into a parallel subfolder that is ignored by OneDrive? Probably easiest to test first on desktop 🔼 
    - [ ] IF NOT mobile-git, could make a single auto-generated index file in the Personal OneNote that just links to all the files in the bin/ repo? Then from mobile obsidian it can find them all without the git repo locally. (But, would be better to set up the mobile git?)
- [-] Was considering writing [PWA that can write files](https://whatpwacando.today/file-system/) into `inbox/` that could receive natives shares? Would shows some toast/notification to let you edit the markdown file?
