App: remove links from tvtropes, Wikipedia, Reddit using some browser extension

## Context

The "Dark Playground" is a concept in the [Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator TED Talk by Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/my-ted-talk.html) where you click down browser links.

![TvTropes](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/tab_explosion_8.png)
If I linked to `https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife` you might go down a rabbit hole of links.

## FIFO inbox
There's a general thought I've had for processing an "inbox" like your Youtube WatchLater[^1] or list of TV shows you want to watch, or webpages to read... if you always add to the end of your list, you are getting a DopamineHit on every click.

If instead, each new items goes to the *end* of the queue, now you have some mental separation. You find you aren't as curious about something anymore, and feel OK just deleting that item without spending time on it.
