## URL scheme `nflx:` not supported on android
Suggested by https://stackoverflow.com/a/34731436 and reddit
tried nflx://www.netflix.com/title/81047300
"no app installed"

## Works to just use the URL
Android app info says it supports `app.netflix.com` or `www.netflix.com` though...

Created android home screen URL shortcut to https://www.netflix.com/Kids?jbv=81047300 using [WebsiteShortcut app](https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/lumberjack-obsidian/pull/17/files)

Seems to work...
- [ ] actually, app might be a bit messed up... might debug this
