I'd be interested to have high-quality (Nintendo) vs. low-quality (Mobile) game tracking in RescueTime, but I'm not seeing any official Nintendo integration...

https://playtracker.net/dashboard/platforms/
- Supports Steam, but not Nintendo Switch
- Doesn't seem to have any API

https://www.exophase.com/ 
- By adding Nintendo Switch friend-code, can see "total playtime" like any other friend
- No API yet: https://forums.exophase.com/threads/rest-api-for-exophase.54528/

- [ ] I do my of my console gaming on a TCL Roku TV: maybe there's some API for that on the local network?
