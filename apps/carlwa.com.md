## Current infra
Source: https://github.com/darthwalsh/darthwalsh.github.io
Just one hardcoded HTML file
Endpoint: https://carlwa.com/
IIRC set this up before GitHub Pages supported HTTPS, so Cloudfront is doing HTTPS termination and proxying
Email: free alias for just forwarding: https://improvmx.com/
## Website skeleton Features
- [ ] Create favicon.ico
- [ ] Link carlwa.com in signature
## Generating HTML from markdown
Need to decide between:
- [[mkdocs]]
	- Also Material: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/
- https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#a-typical-post
- hugo
- http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/examples.html
- https://bearblog.dev/

Should have features to support:
### RSS feed
One for new posts, one for edits?
### Blog/wiki from markdown
More of a [bliky](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html), want to create permanent content here. Anybody can edit with link back to github.com.

Content licensed with some CreativeCommons
- [ ] originally watned NonDerivative, but I like people being able to just fork the repo...?
Any JS code licensed MIT

*MAYBE* If linked entry doesn't exist:
- [ ] link pull-request create it?
- [ ] OR, add failure message because it might be in my personal markdown notes or a deleted page?
### PascalCase links
I thought before I'd want to use the wiki format of any word in PascalCase being a link...
- [ ] now: using `[[Wikilinks]]` syntax -- correctly parsed as links
### Renames
Once I post a URL, I want it to be alive forever even if I want to rename / move article...

one way to handle redirection for article renames:
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/37517e1c9668bb76d0873aa90663dfcbace16a67/.openpublishing.redirection.virtual.json#L1226
(followed links, and googled this `openpublishing` framework and i think it's proprietary to MSFT...)

https://docs.bearblog.dev/post/#alias
### Comments
Chose one of:
- https://github.com/imsun/gitment
- https://giscus.app/
### Gists
Example of how to embed a Gist on GitHub Pages using Jekyll: https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555251
## Email
Around 2015, looked into email hosting for custom domain, and Microsoft/Google/etc. would charge $5 a month.
Originally was going to set up [Hover Webmail](https://support.hover.com/support/solutions/articles/201000064701-the-complete-guide-to-webmail).
Ended up with https://improvmx.com/

Alternative choices:
- https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/main/docs/INSTALL-email.md
## Affiliate Links
Something to consider if hosting costs raise over $0
https://magnet4blogging.net/amazon-affiliate-links/
*In the past I would have linked to Amazon Smile, but that went away :(*

Otherwise, monetize with ads
(Had idea to advertise on YouTube, but that is the opposite ad spend...?)
