URL: https://www.goodreads.com/

API is shut down

web scraper script like BeautifulSoup: https://github.com/kylrth/goodreads2libby/blob/main/get_books.py
This also writes to [[Libby]]

## Considering replacing with GoodReads

https://hardcover.app/blog/goodreads-vs-hardcover
Features I care about:
- API

P2 features that are nice:
- **Did not Finish** reading status
- Reading format: audio
- Open Source, eventually https://hardcover.app/blog/hardcover-report-for-july-2024#:~:text=Open%20Sourcing%20the%20Codebase

Potential blockers / improvements

- [ ] Check their database: 
	- [x] enders game alive https://hardcover.app/books/enders-game-alive-the-full-cast-audioplay
	- [x] worm: https://hardcover.app/books/worm-parahumans-1
	- [ ] weirdness to look into https://hardcover.app/books/de-cirkel "The Circle" 
		- [ ] Ping somebody about this on DiscordÂ [https://discord.com/invite/NgpY8jES](https://discord.com/invite/NgpY8jES) ðŸ”¼
		- [ ] where is the english edition? 
		- [ ] seems like spam/vandalism? what is https://hardcover.app/series/the-circle
- [ ] Can you default to adding books as audiobook format?
- [ ] Can you track multiple reads of the same book
	- [ ] Does it have a better way to export it in API?
- [ ] Does their [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hardcover.app) make it less ardious to add titles from [[Libby]] or [[Audible]]?


- [ ] OR, maybe consider Storygraph app
