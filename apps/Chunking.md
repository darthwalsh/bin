A "chunk" is a unit of thought. It's really powerful when you come across a thought piece that exposes a new way to think, a new crisp abstraction that lets you chunk together multiple ideas, with a new rich connection between them.

In the words of a close friend:
>Putting a word to a concept that everyone already knows about but doesn't have the words to express is powerful. A great poem, painting, or musical piece does the same: expresses something that we all feel more clearly than we could have on our own, giving us language to communicate our human experience, understand each other and be understood. That is deeply satisfying.

A chunk could be an abstraction you've learned as a [concept handle](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3b7sidNrEkNaY9qfGwZjwz). You might wonder "Does Simpson's Paradox apply" and instead of needing to dedicate several of the limited "chunk register" in your brain to considering statistics, trends reversing when groups are combined, the sociological implications...  you instead have a handle/pointer to this exacting concept.

In System Two thinking, we are intentionally manipulating a limited number thoughts. (i.e. "you can only think of 7 things at once.") Having a better understanding of different concepts gives you a better toolset of ways to chunk many thoughts into 7 handles, that let you more effectively get a grip on your slippery thoughts.

If we were going to program an ArtificialGeneralIntelligence that reasons like us, we'll need to step above all the unrefined neural networks that mostly seem to simulate [[LLM AI are like System One thinking|System One thinking]]. You need a System Two that can rule over thousands of different "brain hardware" implementations of vision/audio/language/motor/etc processing.

(The brain handles like 10 bits / second. Imagine if you were going to work with a 10 Hz processor, but control a walking talking robot. You would want some really good hardware chips running LLMs to offload anything that's slightly compute-intensive.)

In [[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis--does language limit thought]], learning new language (grammar/vocab/metaphors) would allow us to think more powerfully: chunking could be a mechanism for that?

[[InnerMonologue]] is somewhat related, but is limited to resolving internal stream of thought into only word-concepts.
