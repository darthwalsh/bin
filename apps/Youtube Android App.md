## Settings > Data Saving > Mobile Data Usage Reminder: `10MB`
No way to disable foreground data usage when on mobile data (i.e. if WiFi stops working and you don't notice and use up mobile data budget.)
Youtube Music app has a toggle to prevent streaming playback on mobile data... but not Youtube app...
Can restrict default playback on mobile data to 240p, which would help but doesn't stop the problem
