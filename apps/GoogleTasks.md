Something weird about Google Tasks: you can assign subtasks to have their own due date.

If you create a subtask while in the "sort by date" mode, it gets the same due date as the parent task--but if you create subtask in "My order" view it does not get any due date.

Then if you switch it back to "sort by date" mode the subtask hierarchy is flattened, and you can't tell which parent a subtask belongs to. Any subtask without a due date ends up sorted to the end with the rest of the No Date items...
