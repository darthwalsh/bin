>I found a setting in Google Takeout to export past location data in KML, rather than JSON, format. KML is understood by [GPSBabel](http://www.gpsbabel.org/) which can convert it into GPX. I can “cut up” the resulting GPX file using [a little grep-fu](https://gist.github.com/Dan-Q/311b032948189bf297da33e00dd62cc1) ([relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/208/)?) to get month-long files and import them into μLogger. Easy!
