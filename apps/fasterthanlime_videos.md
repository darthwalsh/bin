Useful for society to agree on construct for i.e. representing numbers
"Having a name for each number"

Good history for the benefit of little endian number encoding, when streaming in bytes for addition
Also, useful when you have have multiple RAM chips -- first byte 0x42 selects the address in all chips, then second byte 0x02 selects the third chip to be enabled and write to the bus 

Typing assembly by hand
`.data` section that defines global
`.text` section with x86 machine code in intel syntax
Use linker to create .o file
In C code, declare the `fun` symbol as a function
In clang, compile .c with .o, and it works
Because the `.data` sections are merged together, the global vars could be moved, so the linker sets the addresses.
