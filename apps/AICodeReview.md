## GitHub Copilot
### GitHub Next says their tools was sunset
https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-pull-requests/ but generating PR description wasn't really what I was wanting

- [x] Example review: https://github.com/darthwalsh/dotNetBytes/pull/4#discussion_r1885089010 is a little underwhelming
