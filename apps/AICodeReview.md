# PRs from LLMs
## GitHub Copilot
### GitHub Next says their tools was sunset
https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-pull-requests/ but generating PR description wasn't really what I was wanting
### Copilot code review is in preview
Adding `@Copilot` as a reviewer
https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review
- [x] Example review: https://github.com/darthwalsh/dotNetBytes/pull/4#discussion_r1885089010 is a little underwhelming
- [ ] Try again on other coding changes

Also can use [vscode github extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) which has a Copilot Code Review button
- [ ] try on a python change ‚è´ 
## Watermelon
https://github.com/marketplace/watermelon-context
- [x] install on darthwalsh github
- [x] Try using on some changes to repo https://github.com/darthwalsh/bin/pull/1
	- [x] Watermelon didn't activate...
- [ ] Might need to try on a webpage with javascript?
## CodeRabbit
