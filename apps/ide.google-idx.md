It's basically a competitor to [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web) or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
- vscodium in a web browser
- good GCP/Firebase integration
- nix support for installing native dependencies
## Trying it with one of my github projects
- [x] Maybe try with once of the dotnet bytes/bscil?

Tried IDX with gemini. I thought a fair test would be give it a bunch of files with subtle markdown syntax errors and see how it did (from [https://github.com/stakx/ecma-335/pull/22/files](https://github.com/stakx/ecma-335/pull/22/files))  
  
It came to the right conclusion, once I gave it two or three hints about what each problem was or how I wanted it fixed...

*Would* include transcript but not supported yet: [https://idx.uservoice.com/forums/953956-general/suggestions/48779222-export-gemini-chat-transcript](https://idx.uservoice.com/forums/953956-general/suggestions/48779222-export-gemini-chat-transcript)
## Going to cost $19/month
Got an email:
>  Gemini Code Assist is available to try at no cost. After **November 8, 2024**, you can get a [Gemini Code Assist license](https://console.cloud.google.com/gemini-admin)

Given I already pay for GitHub Copilot, I definitely don't need this...
