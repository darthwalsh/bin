One frustration I'm having with Obsidian is being able to copy code snippets out of Obsidian editor 

The problem: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/cleaning-markdown-out-of-some-markers/12395/6?u=darthwalsh
>Nothing is stripped when copying within Obsidian _from edit mode_ because all characters are part of content there

*Possibly solution, regex a selection?*

	- Related, but it's about pasting rich text into obsidian
	- Fixed!

	- Takes some bad PDF-exported text, and converts to nice markdown

TODO some tabs to look into:
