>Didn't you hear me?

In English we answer the non-negated question "Did you hear me?"
- Say "yes" meaning "Yes, I heard."
- Say "no" to agree with the literal question: "No, I did not."

This is [confusing](https://english.stackexchange.com/q/28530/195084), because in other cultures they would say the opposite: "yes" to mean "yes I " 

[Why We Should Bring Back “Yea” and “Nay!” - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gydTlTV6Fwc)
Apparently, English used to have different "yes/no" words for replying to a positive or negative question

"Are you tired?"
- ***Yea***, I am
- ***Nay***, I am not

"Are you not tired?"
- ***Yes***, I am
- ***No***, I am not
