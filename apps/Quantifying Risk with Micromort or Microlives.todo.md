[Micromort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort) quantifies the "risk of dying during an activity" and helps you quantify the immediate risk of death
- [ ] read this, take notes, try out some basic calculation

[Microlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlife) is 30 minutes, and `30min * 1e6 = 57years` so unless you live to 114 it's a decent approximation of 1 millionth of a life.
Compared to micromort, this is a much better way to think about cumulative health negative/positive changes (but still focuses Lifesplan, not to Healthspan)

[maths.org has a good Microlife vs Micromort summary](https://plus.maths.org/content/understanding-uncertainty-microlives)
- [ ] Work out interesting examples, of relative risk of smoking, drinking, and sunburn 


- [ ] look into the relative mortality of sunburn versus cigarettes in microlives
	- 2-3 cigarettes for a microlife according to [maths.org](https://plus.maths.org/content/understanding-uncertainty-microlives)
	- [ ] how many microlives for a bad/small sunburn?

### Cigarette mortality in pregnancy
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32531550
>\[for the baby\] Smoking carries a risk of 
>- 0.21 micromorts per cigarette, OR
>- 300 micromorts for a woman smoking 5/day throughout pregnancy.

(this is only the death risk, ignoring microlife impact)
