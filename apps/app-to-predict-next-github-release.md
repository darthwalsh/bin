### App idea: "web app that predicts when next github release will be."
- e.g. if you parse https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases you could chart the date of the last stable minor releases 7.4.0, 7.3.0, 7.2.0, and look for the correlation with the preview releases of those.
- Then predict out from 7.5.0-previewN releases for when 7.5.0 will ship
- OR: maybe you can scrape something on github metadata that includes roadmap
	- Projects or Projects (classic) -- for PowerShell they're not using that, but other projects probably do
