There should be something like GitHub for spreadsheet enthusiasts. Like, you can upload [[FOSS]] data, and people can fork your tables, and create PRs to add/edit/update data?

Maybe it would let you link your tables to other existing ones and auto-detect foreign key relationships, and append/join/expand tables in interesting ways.
