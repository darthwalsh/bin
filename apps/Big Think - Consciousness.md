## Christof Koch
Consciousness is just the things you experience
Talks about pan psychism: the idea that every thing from a fly to a human as some degree of consciousness.
(My pet theory, maybe consciousness exists on a spectrum through flies, to yeast cells, to atoms. In "Conscious" by Annaka Harris she talks about consciousness being whatever *I* can imagine being like. Like "Being a bat")
It's a property of the universe that there is an outside view, but also an inside view
## Swami Sarvapriyananda
Monk
Maybe you are thinking, or you are **not** thinking, either way you can be conscious of that.
