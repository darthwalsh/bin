Getting Things Done is a productivity [book](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280) by David Allen

## Process
1. Capture
	1. Should always be easy to write down a Fleeting Note
	2. Good explanation of [Fleeting Notes](https://wasabigeek.com/blog/zettelkasten-and-how-to-take-smart-notes/#1a-take-fleeting-notes)
	3. AKA "collection"
	4. 4 D's When a task comes in, one of:
		- Delete
		- Delegate
		- Date-Activate
			- Can use Calendar.app, add things to system calendar? (Harder to use Microsoft Graph API in enterprise.)
		- Do Now (less than 5 minutes, or emergency)
	5. I have [[in.ps1]]
2. Clarify
	1. Process each item in the inbox, choose one:
		- Define a Next Action, i.e. make spikes to answer unknowns
		- Trash
			-  pick one philosophy, When in doubt: "throw it out" vs. "keep it"
		- Someday/Maybe (review weekly; includes books to read, movies to watch)
		- Reference (kept separate from action lists)
	2. Go in order and don't put things back
	3. Related: [Close open loops](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zFuk9QqspNYHAgvzZc33ZGH)
	4. Related: [Inboxes only work if you trust how they’re drained](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zGKqPvetpYbvbXmPmuuvfx8)
	5. I have [[Tasks]]
3. Organize
	1. adding Context tags/projects, add to Reading Inbox, etc.
	2. I have some `#labels` but don't use this enough
4. Review
	1. Weekly glance over every next action
	2. [ ] Book mentions "Assuming you're not *procrastinating*," -- so what if you are?
	3. One place to look over all *unordered* Projects with Next Actions
	4. I have [[Projects]]
5. Engage
	1. Your intuition will probably decide what to do. Four Criteria:
		- Context (e.g., at computer, with phone, with pen/paper)
		- Time available
		- Energy (mental/physical)
		- Priority
	2. i.e. Pomodoro focus time
	3. If you have too many next actions, you can filter by context


## Inbox is *not* automatic

> [!NOTE] My different email / Messenger / [[ReadItLater]] app's inboxes are in-baskets; different than the GTD Inbox!

- [ ] Not sure where "Task Manager" due list fits in

"Inbox" has a normal meaning in your email client or Slack, but a **distinct** meaning in [[GTD]] where you have intentionally added Fleeting Notes. 
Leave emails where they are, and 
## Reading Inbox
Having a Reading Inbox is probably best handled by yet another app, as a way to facilitate step 5: Engage.

[Beware automatic import into the reading inbox](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zL2SPWGitsD4TruNYBzSZ7s?utm_source=pocket_shared):
>It's easy to treat RSS subscriptions, email newsletters, etc as interchangeable with one’s reading inbox, but they should be clearly separated.
## Physical vs. Digital
Calendar is limited to a few sentences, AND big tickler file can both be replaced by [[Obsidian]] ```` ```tasks```` query can easily replace anything marked for date but not any time.
Context can just be `#labels`.
Reference and capture systems with physical filing cabinet is replaced by Obsidian folder and [[obsidian.plugins|OmniSearch plugin]].
###  Tickler system: Snoozing paper items
>A tickler system is an organizational tool, often called the "43 Folders System," used as an adjunct to a calendar to "incubate" or defer items you don't need to see until a specific future date. It keeps time-sensitive tasks or documents out of your main to-do list until they are relevant, "tickling" your memory on the day they need action.
>43: This number breaks down as follows:
> - 31 Folders for the maximum number of days in a month (labeled 1 through 31).  
> - 12 Folders for the months of the year (labeled with the month names).
## Natural Planning Model
Imagine going out to eat: Your subconscious mind is jumping around... thinking about principles, ideas, next steps, purpose.
This of ineffective work meetings without agenda. You spend an hour jumping around parts of this model. *See [[MeetingCostBot]]*

This is a framework that mirrors the way our brains intuitively work when planning.
Doesn't need to be formal, but can breeze through parts.

- Purpose: Why am I doing this?
	- Provides the juice and direction
- Principles: Set boundaries
	- Example heuristic: "I'd give them free rein as long as they ..."
- Outcome visioning: What does "done" look like?
	- We often the one holding ourselves back in goals
	- Imagine "wild success" in the future
	- Use prompts like "Wouldn't it be great if..."
- Brainstorm: Generate ideas
	- [[YesThinking]]: Don't judge; go for quantity; then organize
- Organize: Structure raw ideas
	- Define major components, then sequence, and prioritize
- Next actions: Concrete next steps
	- If difficult, identify where more planning is needed
## Glossary
Next Action: a task that has nothing blocking you from starting it now

Projects are multiple tasks. Name after successful outcome. Can be thought of as a "folder" that group documents and tasks

Tasks can have data:
- Date: Blocked / Someday
- Next Action is the task that should be done next
- Context is like "On PC" "Errand outside house" to allow for easy filtering

Calendar: need to be fairly sacred, so only certain events can go on it: reminders, on a certain date\[time], day-specific committed actions, or general info

Agendas
- [ ] something specific

Someday/Maybe List:
review weekly; includes books to read, movies to watch, projects you are interested in, etc

Threefold Model of daily work. You're either doing one of:
1. Doing predefined work (from your action lists)
2. Doing work as it shows up
3. Defining your work (capturing/clarifying/organizing)

Horizons of Focus (top -> ground metaphor of flight)
- Purpose and Principles (why you/your company exist; principles define parameters of action)
- Vision (3-5 year vision)
- Goals/Objectives (1-2 year outcomes)
	 - See also: [CGP Grey's Your Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) video (youtube)
- Areas of Focus/Accountability (work and personal: e.g., health, home management)
- Projects (often 30-100 active)
- Next Actions (current, visible tasks)

Horizontal vs. Vertical thinking
- Horizontal: tracking across all projects
- Vertical: planning a single project (Natural Planning Model)
