Getting Things Done is a productivity [book](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280) by David Allen
This page is a bit #literature note and my personal feelings.

## 5-step Process
### 1. Capture
1. Should always be easy to write down a Fleeting Note
2. Good explanation of [Fleeting Notes](https://wasabigeek.com/blog/zettelkasten-and-how-to-take-smart-notes/#1a-take-fleeting-notes)
3. AKA "collection"
4. 4 D's When a task comes in, one of:
    - Delete
    - Delegate
    - Date-Activate (Can use Calendar or ToDo with start OR end date)
    - Do Now (less than 5 minutes, or emergency)
5. Imagine being the kind of person who always writes a note when they say they'll do something. (Or, image somebody who **doesn't** jot a note... uh-oh!)
I have [[in.ps1]]
### 2. Clarify
1. Process each item in the inbox, choose one:
    - If you can finish in less than 2-minutes, just do it now.
    - Define a Next Action, i.e. make spikes to answer unknowns
    - Trash (pick *one* philosophy, when in doubt: "throw it out" vs. "keep it")
    - Someday/Maybe (review weekly; includes books to read, movies to watch)
    - Reference (kept separate from action lists)
2. Go in order and don't put things back
3. Related: [Close open loops](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zFuk9QqspNYHAgvzZc33ZGH)
4. Related: [Inboxes only work if you trust how they’re drained](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zGKqPvetpYbvbXmPmuuvfx8)

Everybody will define the next action before working on the task, but you can be proactive. 
> [!quote] Will you find the next action when things **show** up, or when things **blow** up?

I have [[Tasks]]
### 3. Organize
1. adding Context tags/projects, add to Reading Inbox, etc.
I have some `#labels` but don't use this enough
### 4. Review
1. Weekly glance over all *unordered* Projects with Next Actions, including Waiting
2. [ ] Book mentions "Assuming you're not *procrastinating*," -- so what if you are?
3. Different groups of projects can have different review frequencies:
	- Work: Every day
	- Personal commitments: every week
	- "For me" growth projects: when you wrap up a project. Don't make a chore.
I have [[Projects]]
### 5. Engage
1. Your intuition will probably decide what to do. Four Criteria:
    - Context (e.g., at computer, with phone, with pen/paper)
    - Time available
    - Energy (mental/physical)
    - Priority
2. i.e. Pomodoro focus time
3. If you have too many next actions, you can filter by context
4. By emptying your mind of all other nagging tasks, you can enter [[FlowState]]

## Inbox is *not* automatic

> [!NOTE] My different email / Messenger / [[ReadItLater]] app's inboxes are in-baskets; different than the GTD Inbox!

- [ ] Not sure where "Task Manager" due list fits in

"Inbox" has a normal meaning in your email client or Slack, but a **distinct** meaning in [[GTD]] where you have intentionally added Fleeting Notes. 
Leave emails where they are, and 
### Reading Inbox
Having a Reading Inbox is probably best handled by yet another app, as a way to facilitate step 5: Engage.

[Beware automatic import into the reading inbox](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zL2SPWGitsD4TruNYBzSZ7s?utm_source=pocket_shared):
>It's easy to treat RSS subscriptions, email newsletters, etc as interchangeable with one’s reading inbox, but they should be clearly separated.
## Physical vs. Digital
Calendar is limited to a few sentences, AND big tickler file can both be replaced by [[Obsidian]] ```` ```tasks```` query can easily replace anything marked for date but not any time.
Context can just be `#labels`.
Reference and capture systems with physical filing cabinet is replaced by Obsidian folder and [[obsidian.plugins|OmniSearch plugin]].
###  Tickler system: Snoozing paper items
>A tickler system is an organizational tool, often called the "43 Folders System," used as an adjunct to a calendar to "incubate" or defer items you don't need to see until a specific future date. It keeps time-sensitive tasks or documents out of your main to-do list until they are relevant, "tickling" your memory on the day they need action.
>43: This number breaks down as follows:
> - 31 Folders for the maximum number of days in a month (labeled 1 through 31).  
> - 12 Folders for the months of the year (labeled with the month names).
## Natural Planning Model
Imagine going out to eat: Your subconscious mind is jumping around... thinking about principles, ideas, next steps, purpose.
This of ineffective work meetings without agenda. You spend an hour jumping around parts of this model. *See [[MeetingCostBot]]*

This is a framework that mirrors the way our brains intuitively work when planning.
Doesn't need to be formal, but can breeze through parts.

- Purpose: Why am I doing this?
	- Provides the juice and direction
- Principles: Set boundaries
	- Example heuristic: "I'd give them free rein as long as they ..."
- Outcome visioning: What does "done" look like?
	- We often the one holding ourselves back in goals
	- Imagine "wild success" in the future
	- Use prompts like "Wouldn't it be great if..."
- Brainstorm: Generate ideas
	- [[YesThinking]]: Don't judge; go for quantity; then organize
- Organize: Structure raw ideas
	- Define major components, then sequence, and prioritize
- Next actions: Concrete next steps
	- If difficult, identify where more planning is needed

Shouldn't everybody be thinking of next actions! You can't mandate people change the way people feel, but you can influence every meeting you attend by asking towards the end of the meeting "What's the next action here?"
## Source of Negative Feelings
Often people have strong positive *and* negative feelings going through the in-basket. Completing several 2-minute tasks feels great. But everything "I know--I should have done it" is a broken agreement with yourself. To get rid of the bad feeling, can:
- Not have made the agreement. Too late for past agreements, but can temper your future expectations. [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck by Mark Manson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck) encourages this!
- Complete the task. This **does not scale** if you try to boil the ocean doing literally every task. But looking through your task list, you might have a mix of curiosity of "will this solve it" or disgust to power you into finishing something.
-  Negotiate the agreement. Just like you wouldn't leave a friend hanging on a planned meeting, you can make a new agreement.
Instead, if you continually nag yourself you will build up strong negative feelings about a project, leading to avoidance.

Smart people might have the worst problem with procrastinating, because they can vividly imagine the problem being worse than it is. ([[SmartPeopleProblems]])
## Glossary
Next Action: a task that has nothing blocking you from starting it now.
Always think of the physical action you will take; just "Quarterly Conference" doesn't have enough thought. Can be *waiting* for something, but make sure you track the date you started waiting. Don't let your next actions slip into multiple tasks; that degrades your project review.

2-minute rule: Not worth the overhead to put something into the system if you can just cross off that task. Might adjust down to 30-sec or up to 5-min depending on how much free time you have.

Projects: an outcome that needs multiple tasks. Named after successful outcome you committed to. Can be thought of as a "folder" that group tasks and references/documents.

Tasks can have data:
- Date: Blocked / Someday
- Next Action is the task that should be done next
- Context is like "On PC" "Errand outside house" to allow for easy filtering

Calendar: need to be fairly sacred, so only certain events can go on it: reminders, on a certain date\[time], day-specific committed actions, or general info

Agendas
- [ ] something specific

Someday/Maybe List:
review weekly; includes books to read, movies to watch, projects you are interested in, etc

Threefold Model of daily work. You're either doing one of:
1. Doing predefined work (from your action lists)
2. Doing work as it shows up
3. Defining your work (capturing/clarifying/organizing)

Horizons of Focus (top -> ground metaphor of flight)
- Purpose and Principles (why you/your company exist; principles define parameters of action)
- Vision (3-5 year vision)
- Goals/Objectives (1-2 year outcomes)
	- See also: [CGP Grey's Your Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) video (youtube)
- Areas of Focus/Accountability (work and personal: e.g., health, home management)
- Projects (often 30-100 active)
- Next Actions (current, visible tasks)

Horizontal vs. Vertical thinking
- Horizontal: tracking across all projects
- Vertical: planning a single project (Natural Planning Model)
