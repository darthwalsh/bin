Getting Things Done is a productivity [book](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280) by David Allen

## Process
1. Capture
	1. Should always be easy to write down a Fleeting Note
	2. Good explanation of [Fleeting Notes](https://wasabigeek.com/blog/zettelkasten-and-how-to-take-smart-notes/#1a-take-fleeting-notes)
2. Clarify
	1. define a Next Action
	2. i.e. make spikes to answer unknowns
	3. Related: [Close open loops](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zFuk9QqspNYHAgvzZc33ZGH)
	4. Related: [Inboxes only work if you trust how they’re drained](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zGKqPvetpYbvbXmPmuuvfx8)
3. Organize
	1. adding Context tags/projects, add to Reading Inbox, etc
4. Review
	1. One place to look over all Next Action
5. Engage
	1. i.e. Pomodoro focus time

- [ ] Between capture and clarify, when is Next Action defined?

## Inbox is *not* automatic

> [!QUESTION] Are my different email / Messanger / Task Manager / [[ReadItLater]] app's inboxes each an GTD inbox? Or, do I pull items out of app to a centralized GTD inbox?
> **Answer:** The latter

"Inbox" has a normal meaning in your email client or Slack, but a **distinct** meaning in [[GTD]] where you have intentionally added Fleeting Notes. Having a Reading Inbox is probably best handled by yet another app, as a way to facilitate step 5: Engage.

[Beware automatic import into the reading inbox](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zL2SPWGitsD4TruNYBzSZ7s?utm_source=pocket_shared):
>It's easy to treat RSS subscriptions, email newsletters, etc as interchangeable with one’s reading inbox, but they should be clearly separated.
## Glossary
Next Action: a task that has nothing blocking you from starting it now

Projects are multiple tasks. Name after successful outcome. Can be thought of as a "folder" that group documents and tasks

Tasks can have data:
- Date: Blocked / Someday
- Next Action is the task that should be done next
- Context is like "On PC" "Errand outside house" to allow for easy filtering
