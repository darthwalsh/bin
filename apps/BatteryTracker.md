I've been annoyed with the batteries in my bluetooth headphone often dying 
## MVP
P0 Collect battery data from some sort of android app to some file

P1 sync to a cloud dashboard accessible from web dashboard (use hash of email to register? No: Just generate unique ID number!)
P1 notifications when battery is getting low
P1 collect charting start, end times, battery delta

P2 sync to a phone dashboard (android has a system settings widget for active device battery, but this is missing history...)
P2 collect location data (bluetooth, wifi, GPS, charge rate?)

~~also track mobile data usage, then create automated rule to turn on data saver~~ (android has this built-in)
