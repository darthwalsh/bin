Optical Character Recognition
## Windows
[winocr](../win/winocr.ps1) grabs screenshot from clipboard, writes to disk, then uses [PsOcr](https://github.com/TobiasPSP/PsOcr) to write back to clipbard
- [ ] Move the ocr script to bin/win/ #windows 

## macOS
Installed [[raycast.plugins]] that makes this a single operation: https://www.raycast.com/huzef44/screenocr

Old workflow: `CMD+SHIFT+4` to take screenshot, highlight Live Text and copy, then delete.
