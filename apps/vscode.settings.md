>We have added a new developer command **Developer: Download Settings Sync Activity** that downloads all your [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) activity, both on cloud and on your local machine, including the logs. This will help us troubleshoot issues with Settings Sync. We have also created a new view to browse the downloaded activity. You can open the view by running the command **Settings Sync: Show Synced Data** and enabling **SYNC ACTIVITY (DEVELOPER)** view. You can load the downloaded sync activity by selecting the **Load Sync Activity** button in the view as shown below.
