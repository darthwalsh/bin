# Pocket
Only use for ad-hoc reading
Have been using https://getpocket.com/ for a while

Big problem: the simplified view often misses article code blocks and graphics.
e.g. https://kobzol.github.io/rust/python/2023/05/20/writing-python-like-its-rust.html looks like a rendered markdown file so should be trivial to show in simplified view, but without code blocks the article is useless
## Reading goal in Beeminder
In https://www.beeminder.com/darthwalsh/pocket-sand committed to 2 articles archived per week
The beeminder integration works by querying for new archived pocket articles, so I delete articles instead of archiving if I want to
