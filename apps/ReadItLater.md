https://stackshare.io/bookmarking-services are great to solve the problem of bookmarking lots of pages *but never reading them*

# Once I find a good app:
- [ ] Unsubscribe from some READABLE emails
- [ ] update [[INBOX zero notes]]

# Summaries of different apps
- [ ] Read these ⏫ 
- [ ] Read about https://raindrop.io/integrations

# Goals for an app
1. Capture notes/highlights syncing to markdown (i.e. obsidian plugin)
2. Good capture path for android chrome tabs
3. Good "web-view scape hatch" if the reader didn't correctly capture the page simplified view
4. Download simplified page locally
5. *--cut line--*
6. Queries
7. Labels
### RSS client
Using gmail with READABLE filter has not worked, it's a huge firehose of [automatically imported emails](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zL2SPWGitsD4TruNYBzSZ7s) that aren't all interesting.

>It's easy to treat RSS subscriptions, email newsletters, etc as interchangeable with one’s reading inbox

>It’s momentum-sapping to switch back and forth between evaluating items to be read and actually reading

Instead, want to have a few starred sources I always read, and the ability to easily pick-and-choose the occasional other mails into a i've-opted-in-to-read-this list

- [ ] try this RSS reader?? https://artemis.jamesg.blog/
- [ ] set up RSS for your social media https://joeyehand.com/blog/2025/01/15/i-ditched-the-algorithm-for-rssand-you-should-too/#medium-2-reddit

*Related idea: [[MyTube]] for youtube subscriptions.*

Only use for ad-hoc reading
Have been using https://getpocket.com/ for a while

Big problem: the simplified view often misses article code blocks and graphics.
e.g. https://kobzol.github.io/rust/python/2023/05/20/writing-python-like-its-rust.html looks like a rendered markdown file so should be trivial to show in simplified view, but without code blocks the article is useless
### Reading goal in Beeminder
For 2021-2025, in https://www.beeminder.com/darthwalsh/pocket-sand committed to 2 articles archived per week
The beeminder integration works by querying for new archived pocket articles, so I delete articles instead of archiving if I want them not to count.
