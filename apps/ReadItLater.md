https://stackshare.io/bookmarking-services are great to solve the problem of bookmarking lots of pages *but never reading them*

# Goals for an app
1. Capture notes/highlights syncing to markdown (i.e. obsidian plugin)
4. Good capture path for android chrome tabs
2. Good "web-view scape hatch" if the reader didn't correctly capture the page simplified view
3. Download simplified page locally
5. *--cut line--*
6. Queries
7. Labels
# Obsidian Web Clipper
- [x] Installed Kiwi browser
- [ ] Try installing browser extension
# Omnivore

# Pocket
Only use for ad-hoc reading
Have been using https://getpocket.com/ for a while

Big problem: the simplified view often misses article code blocks and graphics.
e.g. https://kobzol.github.io/rust/python/2023/05/20/writing-python-like-its-rust.html looks like a rendered markdown file so should be trivial to show in simplified view, but without code blocks the article is useless
## Reading goal in Beeminder
In https://www.beeminder.com/darthwalsh/pocket-sand committed to 2 articles archived per week
The beeminder integration works by querying for new archived pocket articles, so I delete articles instead of archiving if I want to
