2. Good "web-view scape hatch" if the reader didn't correctly capture the page simplified view
3. Download simplified page locally
5. *--cut line--*
6. Queries
7. Labels

# Pocket
Only use for ad-hoc reading

In https://www.beeminder.com/darthwalsh/pocket-sand committed to 2 articles archived per week
The beeminder integration works by querying for new archived pocket articles, so I delete articles instead of archiving if I want to
