https://stackshare.io/bookmarking-services are great to solve the problem of bookmarking lots of pages *but never reading them*

# Once I find a good app:
- [ ] Unsubscribe from some READABLE emails
- [ ] update [[INBOX zero notes]]

# Summaries of different apps
- [ ] Read these ⏫ 
- [ ] Read about https://raindrop.io/integrations
    - https://forum.obsidian.md/t/raindrop-highlights-my-workflow-integration-of-raindrop-io-into-obsidian/45880
- [ ] Wallabag
- [ ] Goodlinks
- [ ] PaperSpan
	  - [ ] Basic reading app, no Obsidian sync it seems
- [ ] Instapaper
- [ ] Google Keep
- [ ] Readability

# Goals for an app
1. Capture notes/highlights syncing to markdown (i.e. obsidian plugin)
2. Good capture path for android chrome tabs
3. Good "web-view scape hatch" if the reader didn't correctly capture the page simplified view
4. Download simplified page locally
5. *--cut line--*
6. Queries
7. Labels
### RSS client
Using gmail with READABLE filter has not worked, it's a huge firehose of [automatically imported emails](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zL2SPWGitsD4TruNYBzSZ7s) that aren't all interesting.

>It's easy to treat RSS subscriptions, email newsletters, etc as interchangeable with one’s reading inbox

>It’s momentum-sapping to switch back and forth between evaluating items to be read and actually reading

Instead, want to have a few starred sources I always read, and the ability to easily pick-and-choose the occasional other mails into a i've-opted-in-to-read-this list

*Related idea: [[MyTube]] for youtube subscriptions.*

# Pocket
Only use for ad-hoc reading
Have been using https://getpocket.com/ for a while

Big problem: the simplified view often misses article code blocks and graphics.
e.g. https://kobzol.github.io/rust/python/2023/05/20/writing-python-like-its-rust.html looks like a rendered markdown file so should be trivial to show in simplified view, but without code blocks the article is useless
## Reading goal in Beeminder
In https://www.beeminder.com/darthwalsh/pocket-sand committed to 2 articles archived per week
The beeminder integration works by querying for new archived pocket articles, so I delete articles instead of archiving if I want to 

# Paid plans
## Readwise no free plan
Cheapest plan is [$5/month](https://readwise.io/pricing)

## Matter free doesn't have notes
https://hq.getmatter.com/
[Free version](https://hq.getmatter.com/patron)
>So, the free version of Matter will consist of basic read-it-later: an unlimited library, the ability to save all types of content with our mobile and web extensions, best-in-class parsing and readability, unlimited tags, and other organizational features.
>Matter Premium will cost $8/month or $60/year and will include features that go beyond the basics: HD text-to-speech, ==fluid highlighting and note-taking==, integrations, full-text search, options to personalize Matter, and priority support.

# Shutting Down
## Stash.ai paid, and shut down
https://stash.ai/ doesn't work

## Upnext shutting down
https://www.getupnext.com/
>Upnext is shutting down on March 1st.

## Infoflow was shutting down
https://www.infoflow.app/
[blog](https://flat-process-26e.notion.site/The-Future-of-InfoFlow-12f9f88d0aab8046a74bf99f036dd0a8) where they *were* shutting down, but going to keep going... doesn't inspire a lot of confidence
