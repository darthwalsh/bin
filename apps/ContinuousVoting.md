An idea I've thought a lot about: **continuous voting**

i.e. letting voters choose any number from a continuous scale, rather than picking/ranking/rating from a fixed set of options.
Instead of voting on a property tax rate increase from 1% to 2%, each voter writes their ideal floating point percentage and the final result is based on some average (median?)

(I was thinking about the fallacy of a false dilemma, but current voting rules for approving local measures actually create a "true" dilemma!)
