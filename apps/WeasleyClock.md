# Weasley Location Clock app
Mobile app would track your location as one bucket like
- home
- work
- driving
- passenger
- walking

And would also show a status. I might configure "when I'm driving is a great time to call me" but you could set the opposite.

See [Weasley Clock wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Weasley_Clock) for the Harry Potter lore.

*This app could be good for people who have several Google Location Realtime Sharing, but don't want to check if their friends are still at work/driving before calling.*

How can a phone tell if you are driving? Maybe some heuristic that if you're constantly tapping on your phone you better not be driving ;)

(Or, when iPhone driving mode prompts you, there's a button to say you're a passenger)

## People who are on board
- Gordon
