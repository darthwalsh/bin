# Taxonomy of "Why" Questions

When someone asks "why," the real question is: *what kind of answer would satisfy you?* Aristotle noticed this 2,400 years ago and identified [four types of "cause"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes) (really: four types of *explanation*). Modern cognitive science ([Tania Lombrozo](https://cognition.princeton.edu/research) et al.) confirms that people naturally distinguish between these modes, and that the type of explanation shapes how we reason about causation, learning, and category membership.

The core types below cover everything from a toddler's "why is the sky blue?" to an undergraduate exam. Most of the 9+ categories you see in textbooks collapse into these four, plus one Aristotle didn't include.

## The Four (+1) Core Types

### 1. Mechanistic — "What caused it?"
*Backward-looking. Traces cause → effect chains.*

[Aristotle's Causality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/) includes **efficient cause**: the agent, force, or process that produced the outcome. This is what modern English usually means by "cause."

| Variant | Focus | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Pure causal** | Direct mechanism | "Why does heat speed up reactions?" → molecular kinetic energy |
| **Historical** | Causal chains over time | "Why did Rome fall?" → economic decline, invasions, instability |
| **Methodological** | Why a procedure works | "Why use a control group?" → isolates the independent variable |

Historical is just mechanistic explanation with the timespan stretched—from milliseconds (chemistry) to centuries (history). Methodological is mechanistic reasoning applied to *how we investigate* rather than *what we're investigating*.

### 2. Teleological — "What's it for?"
*Forward-looking. Explains by purpose, function, or meaning.*

Aristotle's **final cause**: the end or goal something serves. Lombrozo's research shows people accept [teleological explanations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) only when the function actually played a causal role—"hearts exist to pump blood" works; "rain exists to water plants" doesn't.

| Variant | Focus | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Functional** | Biological/design role | "Why do plants have stomata?" → gas exchange |
| **Intentional** | Agent's goals/motives | "Why are you doing that?" → understanding someone's purpose |
| **Interpretive** | Symbolic meaning | "Why does the author use red?" → passion and danger |
| **Pragmatic** | Practical utility | "Why use renewable energy?" → reduces emissions |

Interpretive is teleological reasoning applied to art and symbol—asking "what does it *mean*" is asking "what purpose does the symbol serve." Intentional foregrounds a conscious agent; functional doesn't require one.

### 3. Normative — "Why should it be this way?"
*Evaluative. Justifies rather than describes.*

Not in Aristotle's original four, but essential. This is the only type that deals in *[ought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) rather than is*—moral reasoning, ethical principles, social rules.

| Variant | Focus | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Moral/ethical** | Right and wrong | "Why is lying wrong?" → undermines trust |
| **Social norms** | Rules and expectations | "Why do we share toys?" → fairness, cooperation |

Toddlers asking normative questions are learning the rules of the world. Undergrads answering them need to appeal to principles, not just describe what happens.

### 4. Logical — "Why must it be true?"
*Deductive. Derives conclusions from premises.*

Aristotle's **formal cause**: the structure, definition, or pattern that makes something what it is. In practice, this shows up as [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof), derivation, or theoretical justification.

| Variant | Focus | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Mathematical** | Axiomatic derivation | "Why do triangle angles sum to 180°?" → Euclidean postulates |
| **Definitional** | What a term/concept means | "Why is that called a car?" → the category boundaries |

### 5. Structural — "What is it made of?"
*Compositional. Explains by describing parts and their arrangement.*

Aristotle's **material cause**: the substance or components. Less commonly phrased as "why" in everyday speech, but shows up in science ("Why is diamond hard?" → [carbon lattice structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond#Material_properties)) and engineering.

## Question Modifiers (Not Separate Types)

These aren't types of explanation—they're *lenses* you can apply to any of the core types above.

**Comparative** — "Why A instead of B?"
Asks for any of the above explanations, but scoped to the *difference* between two things. "Why did one species survive?" could get a mechanistic, teleological, or structural answer—the comparative framing just narrows the focus.

**Elaborative** — "Tell me more"
A depth request, not a question type. The child asking "why does it work that way?" wants to go one level deeper into whatever explanation type is already in play.

## Non-Explanation Uses of "Why" for Engagement
"Why? Why? Why?"
Sometimes "why" isn't seeking information. In toddlers, it's often maintaining interaction, testing consistency, or probing how far a conversation will stretch. In adults, the equivalent is the rhetorical "why not?" used as a challenge rather than a genuine question.

This is related to normative questioning (testing rules), but the intent is social, not informational. See [[curiosity]] for how **state curiosity** vs. social engagement can look similar on the surface.

## Anchoring to Aristotle

| Aristotle's Cause | Modern Label | Question | Direction |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Efficient | **Mechanistic** | What caused it? | Backward |
| Final | **Teleological** | What's it for? | Forward |
| Formal | **Logical** | Why must it be? | Structural |
| Material | **Structural** | What's it made of? | Compositional |
| *(not in Aristotle)* | **Normative** | Why should it? | Evaluative |

## Meta-Pattern: Information Gaps and Curiosity

All genuine "why" questions reflect an **information gap**—a perceived hole in understanding. The question type reveals what kind of gap exists and what would fill it.

See [[curiosity]] for trait vs. state curiosity and information gap theory. See [[SmartTraits]] for **tolerance for ambiguity**—the ability to sit with an unfilled gap without rushing to a bad answer.
