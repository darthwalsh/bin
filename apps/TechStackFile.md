# My Design Sketch
- Probably first YAML file with each of our cloud resources
- Nice to have some markdown blurb too
- Would be good to have some cloud automation, but also be able to run locally

## e.g. stack for https://github.com/darthwalsh/dotNetBytes
- Status: Maintenance mode (or Active, Alpha, Done, etc.)
- Languages
    - C#
    - JS
    - IL
- Framework
    - dotnet6
        - *deprecated e.g. 2028-01-01*
    - browser JS
    - mstest v2
- CI/CD
    - Appveyor
        - link: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/darthwalsh/dotnetbytes
        - Images: Win10 VS2022
    - *9/10 last builds succeeded*
- Cloud:
    - GCP Function
        - version: v1
        - runtime dotnet6
        - *deprecated e.g. 2025-01-01*
    - *Billing: free tier*
- Databases
- Publish to:
    - Docker images/registory
    - nuget/npm library
    - cloud S3 bucket
    - Github Pages / CloudFlare Pages
- Dependency automated update:
- Published libraries to nuget

Key:
- *italics:* nice to have, but could be added in some post-processing state and not in YAML

Then last, I could have a script to combine the tables into one big my-projects stack?
- Maybe use symlink or markdown embed

- [ ] idea: copy some of the markdown-summary/techstack.md or YML syntax from https://github.com/stackshareio/awesome-stacks/pull/77/files#diff-937a76ed9e53c397ca8eff62b127e9cdcdceb26d9752e92522d5271661d6ad15
# StackShare

> Hi Stack ShareÂ @ FOSSA,

> I was talking to my sister about wanting a standardized YAML manifest file of which tools each of my github projects uses, and came acrossÂ [https://stackshare.io/tech-stack-file](https://stackshare.io/tech-stack-file)Â which sounds like theÂ _perfect_Â solution!
