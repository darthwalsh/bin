Going away :( so I want to replace my use-cases:
1. Dashboard of all bank accounts, credit cards, investments, home, mortgage, vehicles
	1. P2: Shows past history
2. Export transactions into unified CSV
3. P2: auto-categorize transactions (didn't do a great job, and I wasn't using this for serious budgeting anway)
4. P2: free credit reports
	

## Empower
Trying https://www.empower.com/investment-checkup

Dashboard looks really pretty.

- [ ] Working on import obsidian://open?vault=MyNotes&file=Empower%20import%20TODO

Signing up, they scheduled 30 minute phone call - but no fee so far

- [ ] Problem: My Fidelity CD "Fifth Third Bank, National Association" value is showing as negative on the dashboard, making the investment account balance wrong.

##  Google Pay
Can import checking accounts, but not seeing away to import investment accounts

Can view transactions on desktop: [https://pay.google.com/pay/u/0/transactions](https://pay.google.com/pay/u/0/transactions)  
Don't see a way to filter by account on the web, and can't export anyways. 

It WAS ***TRICKY*** to import WellsFargo; it was already added through Venmo, so it wasn't directly available when signing into to Plaid using my phone number(?) Connecting to Plaid as guest let me add my WF account just fine.)  

## Plaid
[my.plaid.com](http://my.plaid.com/) can manage connections, but not export  
[dashboard.plaid.com](http://dashboard.plaid.com/) is a developer tool for managing your Plaid App; not useful  

## Tiller App
Sounds like you can dump data into excel sheet. $80/year for me, cheaper to just manually export checking account as CSV
