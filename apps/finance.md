Good overview of options: https://www.reddit.com/r/mintuit/comments/17vidx5/comparison_of_mint_alternatives/

## Mint
https://mint.intuit.com/overview 
Going away :( so I want to replace my use-cases:
1. Dashboard of all bank accounts, credit cards, investments, home, mortgage, vehicles
2. Export transactions into unified CSV
3. P2: Shows past net worth history
4. P2: auto-categorize transactions (didn't do a great job, and I wasn't using this for serious budgeting anyway)
5. P2: free credit reports
	
- [x] Export pre-2023 transaction CSV
	- [x] `~\OneDrive\TODO\mint_export_transactions.csv`
	- [x] `~\OneDrive\TODO\mint_export_transactions2.csv` (extras beyond 10,000 export limit)
- [x] Export net worth history
	- [x] `~\OneDrive\TODO\mint_net_worth_history.csv"`
- [x] NOPE Export anything else?
## Empower
Trying https://www.empower.com/investment-checkup

Dashboard looks really pretty.
Doesn't support credit reports, but that's fine

#### My progress:

- [ ] Working on import obsidian://open?vault=MyNotes&file=Empower%20import%20TODO
	- [x] 90% done
- [x] Manually Classified Holdings 
- [x] Try with my checking

Signing up, they scheduled 30 minute phone call -  no fee so far

- [ ] Problem: My Fidelity CD "Fifth Third Bank, National Association" value is showing as negative on the dashboard, making the investment account balance wrong.
	- [x] Reported to support chat
	- [x] Reported to support email
	- [ ] Maybe related to CD setting next week?
- [x] Problem: my mortgage didn't load, but I'll give it a few more day -- FIXED!

##  Google Pay
Can import checking accounts, but not seeing away to import investment accounts

Can view transactions on desktop: [https://pay.google.com/pay/u/0/transactions](https://pay.google.com/pay/u/0/transactions)  
Don't see a way to filter by account on the web, and can't export anyways. 

It WAS ***TRICKY*** to import WellsFargo; it was already added through Venmo, so it wasn't directly available when signing into to Plaid using my phone number(?) Connecting to Plaid as guest let me add my WF account just fine.)  

## Plaid
Not a personal finance app, don't get confused!
[my.plaid.com](http://my.plaid.com/) can manage connections, but not export  
[dashboard.plaid.com](http://dashboard.plaid.com/) is a developer tool for managing your Plaid App; not useful
