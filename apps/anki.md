## AnkiWeb sync protocol is proprietary
Started with #app-idea: combine an Anki client with an idle game that I want to open daily. That way you reward learning!

I came across [https://ankiweb.net/account/terms](https://ankiweb.net/account/terms)  

> You may access AnkiWeb ... through the synchronization functionality incorporated into the approved clients (Anki, AnkiMobile, AnkiDroid, and AnkiUniversal).  
> AnkiWeb does not currently allow access from browser extensions or other third-party clients  
  
Would need AnkiConnect plugin running in desktop app, but the desktop app is mainly supported on x86, and I only have ARM mini-PCs that I would want to leave on 24/7...
