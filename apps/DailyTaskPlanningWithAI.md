- [x] Try dumping some ToDos into BeforeSunset ‚è´ ‚úÖ 2024-11-19

- didn't get much value from "AI planning"
	- Used too many tokens to use daily on free plan
- manual work to copy TODOs over; could I import them?
	- >The feature to **import tasks from other task manager apps** is currently **planned** but has **no ETA**
	- Manual work to set priority, project, expected time
- I like the idea of a [Day Planner](https://www.beforesunset.ai/post/best-day-planner-apps-for-planning) -- being able to drag Microsoft ToDo entries into the calendar was great. 
## Try Tori
- [ ] https://www.tori.gg/app/home try dumping hipri ‚è´ 
- [ ] based on [Sunsama compare](https://www.sunsama.com/compare), maybe try Reclaim.ai or Motion or Akiflow app

- [ ] NEXT https://www.trevorai.com/
## Sunsama is too expensive
has lots of possible apps to deal with [[Tasks|inbox tasks]]
- [ ] look through all the [integrations](https://www.sunsama.com/integrations/asana); consider how I could represent/authenticate, etc
