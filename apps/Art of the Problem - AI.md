Really interesting exploration of five stages of learning:
1. Nerve net: Primitive worms has neurons hard-coded in DNA that could navigate towards food
	1. (I think the video is oversimplifying) this was the same behavior using [[chemotaxis]] to move towards food, but that was in single-celled organisms
2. Trial and error: Early fishes have senses go into layers of neurons (cortex). Think skinner box
3. Simulation: Mammals can do this in neocortex. Rats stop in maze, imagined going down path
4. 3rd person Simulation: Primates have theory of mind: granual prefrontal cortex. Learn from observing another's mistake or tool-making
5. Language: Humans. We can simulate ideas based on words. We can learn from other's imagination

|                      | Learning from Self                 | Learning from Others          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Physical Actions** | Reinforcement in early vertebrates | Mentalizing in early primates |
| **Imagined**         | Simulated in early mammals         | Speaking in early humans      |

- Connection with Large Language Models. Can a system short-cut learning all the earlier steps and jump straight into "understanding" by starting with language

I see some application towards [[ExpLang]]:
- The dopamine behavior of the learned senses means that you have expectations about what will happen next.
- Are simulations the same as explaining thinking through, enumerating different options?
- Language is powerful. Does human language have something that is missing, once you turn math into simple symbolic equations. 
- Maybe there's a reason that historical math always used written out sentences. Or, is it just as good for a kid to learn arithmetic from symbols instead of from word problems?
