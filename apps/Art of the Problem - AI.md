[Art of the Problem](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtOfTheProblem) has an an interesting [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbg3ZX2pWlgKV8K6bFJr5dhM7oOClExUJ) about [[AI]].

Evolution of learning is fascinating, talking through different ways that early learning hard codes knowledge into DNA, but now we as individuals can learn during our lives
## [How AI Learns (Backpropagation 101)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1U6fenGTrU)
- [ ] Notes

Talked about the first first neural networks, really interesting comparison to [CGP Grey: How AI *Really* Learns](https://youtu.be/wvWpdrfoEv0?si=az0uD5X6Ssc9i9b8&t=56) wall of dial adjustment bot.
Making the switch from binary output to floating point output meant that you could wiggle the dials and see how the output wiggles. I think this is talking using derivatives: the differential?

- [ ] Notes

- in 2D, linear neuron splits the space into two based on some line
- can have multiple neurons with other splits, which divide up the region with many slices 
Then the next region of neurons as an easy job just picking which regions it wants 
- doesn't account for Non-Linear neurons
	- [ ] i thought that combinations of linear was lacking an essential piece that you need a different activation function for...?
	- [ ] Maybe try to find that video that built up an explanation/motivation of non-linear functions, and how the "if x < 0 then y=0; else y = x" function was a "universal function approximator"

## [How Intelligence Evolved - The Role of Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EcQ1IcEMFQ)
Really interesting exploration of five stages of learning:
1. Nerve net: Primitive worms has neurons hard-coded in DNA that could navigate towards food
	1. (I think the video is oversimplifying) this was the same behavior using [[chemotaxis]] to move towards food, but that was in single-celled organisms
2. Trial and error: Early fishes have senses go into layers of neurons (cortex). Think skinner box
3. Simulation: Mammals can do this in neocortex. Rats stop in maze, imagined going down path
4. 3rd person Simulation: Primates have theory of mind: granual prefrontal cortex. Learn from observing another's mistake or tool-making
5. Language: Humans. We can simulate ideas based on words. We can learn from other's imagination

|                      | Learning from Self                 | Learning from Others          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Physical Actions** | Reinforcement in early vertebrates | Mentalizing in early primates |
| **Imagined**         | Simulated in early mammals         | Speaking in early humans      |

- Connection with Large Language Models. Can a system short-cut learning all the earlier steps and jump straight into "understanding" by starting with language

- [ ] Learn more: "A brief history of intelligence" ~Max Bennett (maybe with ReadWise?)

I see some application towards [[ExpLang]]:
- The dopamine behavior of the learned senses means that you have expectations about what will happen next.
- Are simulations the same as explaining thinking through, enumerating different options?
- Language is powerful. Does human language have something that is missing, once you turn math into simple symbolic equations. 
- Maybe there's a reason that historical math always used written out sentences. Or, is it just as good for a kid to learn arithmetic from symbols instead of from word problems?

Related: [[Consciousness]]
1. Early in evolution, simple creations starting at basic perception of themselves, allowing for *chemotaxis*
2. Then getting distance perception, like vision
3. Then getting memory, allowing for object permanence
4. Then getting theory of mind
5. Then language as the ultimate tool, allowing for complex though, planning, and communication
