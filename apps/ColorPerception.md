- really cool color charts for how different cultures map sensory input of photon wavelength to colors
	- Images in video seem pretty copyrighted, but see [online PDF with many helpful graphics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/9-59j-lab-in-psycholinguistics-spring-2017/6aae03e88b3bd1007eccf1df4a359b62_MIT9_59jS17_lec14.pdf)
- "is my blue the same as your blue" has a definite answer of "no" if you speak a different language than English which has a different color map 
- people who speak a language that doesn't differentiate between blue and green the way that we do have a harder time remembering (something?)
	- PDF p. 14 "Berinmo and English speakers each had a harder time learning to sort chips into categories based on color contrasts that were not in their language"
- sensory versus perception 
	- how would you categorize the sensory versus perception for having a thought? 
	- For having a decision?
	- Can a definition of absolute threshold which is "the smallest amount of stimulus. We can register 50% of the time" be applied to sense of thought or decision
- Subliminal Message is when a stimulus doesn't cross that absolute threshold. 
- Illusions: when perception does not match sensation 
	- McGurk Effect: when the audio doesn't match the video and and you hear *something*
