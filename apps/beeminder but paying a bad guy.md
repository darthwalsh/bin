[[Beeminder]] is a powerful tool for using the threat of losing money. But it doesn't always work for me, because sometimes I'm OK with just giving *my* money to a company that makes a good product.

But I read [What's Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies by Tim Urban](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102146148-what-s-our-problem) and he had a more extreme version of this commitment: if he didn't deliver his book manuscript on time, both him and his friend would need to donate a substantial amount of money to a group he really disliked. 

The app would be build a service like Beeminder, but automating this kind of strict goal. America has dozens of political divides that people feel strongly about; *there's bound to be one group that you would absolutely refuse to give a penny to.*

## Will Beeminder implement this?
I think Beeminder has half of this idea, where you invite a partner to your goal. I think it's [this Group Goal](https://blog.beeminder.com/groupies/)  setting but I thought I read about a slightly different idea...

And they [address](https://help.beeminder.com/article/114-can-i-specify-a-beneficiary-for-my-derailments) the other half of this idea: they don't like penalty donations to anti-charities to make the world a worse play.
