- [ ] [LENGTH and LINKING in British, American and Australian accents!](https://youtu.be/tPi2jtU7Tl4?si=XSEteiC74Dsg8cpK): Accents vowels have different lengths faaather

>Use pitch manipulation for accents! First get a lot of voice samples of different accents then find some algorithm to shift the pitch on specific vowels in specific words-- that would make for a pretty neat Instagram "filter" if you could give yourself an Irish or Scottish accent?

- The way to learn about transcription is to create a narration API that the first thing to do is to look at vowels doing a Fourier transform over 0.1 second intervals and looking for the in the frequency domain how diphthongs look
- An interesting test would be to try to speech recognition of songs, and see how closely you can match the official lyrics #app-idea created: 2018-02-18
- Could you separate out the singing and different instruments into different tracks?
