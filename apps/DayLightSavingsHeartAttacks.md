[Daylight Saving Time Explained - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84aWtseb2-4) claims:
>Sleep depravation can lead to heart attacks and suicides and the Daylight Saving Time Monday has a higher than normal spike in both.

But [Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World  by Matt Parker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R8QSXYB) points out
>It seems the clocks going forward and depriving people of sleep did cause extra heart attacks, but only in people who would have had a heart attack at some point anyway. The heart attack merely happened sooner. And likewise, the clocks going back gave people a rest and bought them a few more days until their heart turned on them. This could be relevant information for a hospital planning its staffing around when the clocks go forward, but it does not mean daylight saving time is net dangerous.

So, daylight savings only decreases [[lifespan]] by a couple days (but decreasing [[healthspan]] of people's pre-heart-attack days too?)
