There are a couple main questions I would ask to test if some element is part of your***self***.
- If you were going to be replaced by a clone of yourself[^1] or an A.I. copy, what is required for them to have in order for you to be at peace with not continuing to exist?
	- e.g. if the clone was identical in all ways except the opposite left- vs. right-handed, would you feel a sense of loss? Is your handedness a fundamental part of your self?
- If a thing were to be taken away from you, would it violate your sense of self?

## Flashlight metaphor 
In [[InnerMonologue]] Hank Green says there are multiple definitions of self, that all interact. He also explains up the Attention/Flashlight metaphor as all being parts of self.

My ordered list of what is vs. is-not self.
1. Values: what is important to you, and drives your inner priorities?
	1. In the Flashlight metaphor, the "hand on the flashlight" decides where to shine your attention based on your values
	2. Different people **identify** as e.g. an athlete, a mother, smart, etc. and those identities are part of your values.
	3. Some people highly value money or prestige, so this could be part of their self
2. Your physical body
	1. Including any physical protheses.
	2. I *think* many people wouldn;t consider their close friend's/family's bodies as part of their self
3. -- *cut line, below here I'd say aren't part of self* --
4. In the Flashlight metaphor, the thing that is the flashlight
