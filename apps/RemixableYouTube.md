"github but for video"

Youtube-like app where all videos have a [[FOSS]] and/or CC license, and instead of uploading "released rendered videos" you upload the source assets instead.

You could *fork* any video project, to [remix](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series) it with a small change or to use just a small part of it.
Instead of YouTube comments, you could open an *issue* if there is a bug, create a *pull request* if you want to fix it, or start a threaded *discussion*.
Would be cute to *star* a video instead of liking it.

Could have much cheaper hosting costs if the web servers doesn't actually transcode or stream video files, but instead the client receives the assets and renders the "video" locally?
