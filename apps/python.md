## Tools to try:
- [ ] Deep inspection of Python objects https://igrek51.github.io/wat/
## Installation
- system package manager is a fallback
- pyenv is nice for per-project python, but want to try [[package manager]] `mise` or uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/#python-version-files

Right now using
```bash
uv python install --default --preview
```
- [ ] Try this on macOS
