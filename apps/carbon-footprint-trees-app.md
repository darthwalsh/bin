(Somewhat related to Wren app)

An idea I got from a friend, about carbon footprint tracking:
>What if we equated individual green house gas emissions with trees. And, had an app with your own personal forest to keep track. Fill up your car with gas, and lose a tree; I haven't done the calculations yet to see the equivalent :-) Pay your electric bill, another tree. Flight, 3 trees. A load of plastic in your trash... Might make people want to plant more trees! Or make less CO2.
