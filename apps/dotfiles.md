- [ ] Also, https://mitxela.com/projects/dotfiles_management using `--work-tree=/`

[GNU `stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is the classic tool for this, but it is \*nix only :(
- [ ] On windows, does git-bash allow running this or e.g. yadm?

[`yadm`](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) is another tool
	- [\*nix only](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/issues/363)
	- https://yadm.io/docs/bootstrap script could i.e. run
		- brew install from `Brewfile`
		- `defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 PrefsCustomFolder "$HOME/.iterm2"`
- [ ] Read https://yadm.io/docs/alternates and look at other features
