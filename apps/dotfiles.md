Features that are required for me to find tool useful
- alternate files per device
- in a git repo
- *--nice to have cut line--*
- in same `bin\` git repo
- secret encryption/decryption
## Established tools
Summary: https://www.chezmoi.io/comparison-table/

### [GNU `stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is the OG
- its \*nix only
- [x] On #windows, does git-bash/WSL allow running this from a windows pwsh.exe shell?
    - sure, WSL can run anything
- [ ] Read manual, looking for features ðŸ”¼ 
    - [ ] Import from [[Stow]]

### [`yadm`](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) is another tool
- [\*nix only](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/issues/363)
- https://yadm.io/docs/bootstrap script could i.e. run
	- brew install from `Brewfile`
	- `defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 PrefsCustomFolder "$HOME/.iterm2"`
- [x] On #windows, does git-bash/WSL allow running this from a windows pwsh.exe shell? see [workaround](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/issues/363#issuecomment-973837636)
    - sure, WSL can run anything
- [ ] NEXT, see rewrite in https://github.com/jyfzh/PSYadm

- [ ] Read https://yadm.io/docs/alternates for different files on different systems. ðŸ”¼ 
- [ ] NEXT, look at other features

### PSDotFiles
https://github.com/ralish/PSDotFiles
- Wants a componentized folder structure... kinda complicated?
- example usage: https://github.com/ralish/dotfiles

## Investigate: use bare git repo?

- [ ] this might conflate bare git repo and/or worktree. need to re-read the below
Bare git repos should avoid needing to use symlinks.
Instead of a tool to manage symlinks, could use a bare git repo?
