## [TIL Some People Have an "Inner Monologue" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmTMU39tPgM)
- It's strange that Hank remembers having an [[Inner Monologue]] when he was a teenager, but knows he **doesn't** have one now.
- Describes "not having an Internal Monologue" as thinking in thoughts. Thought of your brother brings in other, related, thought bubbles.
- Thinking in words seems less efficient
- Still experiences words when thinking about what to say or write 
- Interesting to compare to [aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia): is it correlated one way or another?
- "if you have Internal Monologue, the process of converting it into words is easier"
	- That's the same idea I had!
- "wild thing is how little thinking about thinking ... could uncover some clear truths about the thinking. A Consciousness would be good at figuring out what a Consciousness is"
	- [ ] Yup! I've had the idea that "Any conscious being has insufficient intelligence to understand the complexities of their own consciousness"
- Different definitions of "self"
	- "I know who I am"
	- all the ideas about myself
	- all the stories I've told about myself
	- metaphor of experience: attention being a flashlight that my hand shines on real/mental
	- self is the flashlight/attention/the-thing-experiencing/hand
	- physical body and experiences from it
	- All Of The Above
	- But NOT the part of me that focuses on worries, because can't control that
		- *Can't control several of the things above*
- Could these different "me" components be collaborating with each, despite not being aware of each other
	- Oh! kind of like CGP Grey's [You Are Two video about split brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8)
- Doesn't have internal monologue about all that, too big
