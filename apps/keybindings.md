I try to have similar keybinding/hotkeys across different text editors, across Windows and macOS.

[[obsidian.keybindings]]
- [ ] Write script that can parse i.e. `~\OneDrive\PixelShare\.obsidian\hotkeys.json` and `~\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\keybindings.json`?
    - [ ] JSON format is different
    - [ ] Does it need to take into account the **default** keybindings too?
    - [ ] windows keyboard has ctrl/WIN/alt, while macos remapped with ctrl/alt/cmd
    - [ ] Goal is to make it easier to think about i.e. "CTRL+B" shouldn't be toggle sidebar because it's already BOLD

[[vscode.keybindings]]
- [ ] Maybe turn off setting-sync for keybindings, and symlink to git or drive?
- [ ] import all these notes from #OneNote
[[Karabiner-Elements]]
- [ ] import all these notes from #OneNote

[[AutoHotKey]]
- [ ] import all these notes from #OneNote
- [ ] defined in [media.ahk](../win/media.ahk)
