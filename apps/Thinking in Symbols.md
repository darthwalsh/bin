- There's a common assumption that people have, that they either think in words (like an internal monolog) or not, like thinking in concepts or images or memories?
- Most external artifacts of thinking we have (words in speech/writing) are in *symbols*
- It seems likely that the brain has a lot of flexibility if thoughts are in "vectors space"
- Internal state of deep neural networks in instead in "vector space"
	- It's a [[LinearCombination]] of neural activity!
- Pinker thinks that all brains think in a language he called "Mentalese"
	- I had been hesitant to call the "alien vector space" a "language" as I'm not sure it meets the rules
	- (So, even if you aren't partially bilingual i.e. hearing Spanish but translating every sentence to English in your head)
	- Pinker says that your brain is automatically converting English to Mentalese
- Machine Learning gives us the ability to convert a word -> vector
	- AI Neural Networks would think of this as [[Word Embeddings]] 
	- Embeddings let you do math like: E(King) - E(man) + E(woman) => E(Queen)
- In the evolution of complex thought and complex language, wouldn't it be complementary that if someone was able to think deeper thoughts, it would be an advantage for them to be able to express those in language, and then that puts pressure on other individuals to be able to think deeper thoughts to understand
  - Similar to [[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis--does language limit thought]]:
	- I'm unsure if this is Evolutionary Psychology, or how scientific it is...
