- Might look something like helicopter game UI with space to float, but it's impossible to win single-player
- First Play, nothing interesting happens
- Game draws out a line of where you went, until you invariably crash or something
- Can pick parts of the path, where you can go back and change your actions
	- Maybe the UI would look like ToolAssistedSpeedRunning for getting perfect 
- What if P2 shows up as P1 from the future, and you play as both P1 and P2 until you get P1 to the time portal,
