For work, have used AWS Lambda with python, private cloud, and Azure Web Apps.
For personal, have used GCP/Firebase Functions and Azure Web Apps.

I'm unhappy with the vendor-lock-in that comes from integrating into these frameworks.
Wouldn't setting up a docker image that runs an HTTP server be much more stable?

What is a good scale-to-zero web host that's simple for hobbyists? 

1. [[hosting.fly|fly.io]] looks great to try, and I'm ok with spending pennies
2. [render](https://render.com/pricing) has a better free tier, and seems better if you need databases and/or don't care about framework setup
3. https://container-hosting.anotherwebservice.com/ looks nice to use, but pretty bare-bones and I would rather pick a"boring" service i expect to be online in 10 years
