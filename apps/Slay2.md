- Multiplayer, delayed opponent turn playing
- Shapes, merging
- glowing pulsing colors
- Level editor
- Fog of war, soft hard, watch/towers see in fog of war
- Pickup of money.
- Tiles have different value
- Pay money to add/remove base
- Move your hut? Attacking hut to gain money.
- Squashing guys costs health
