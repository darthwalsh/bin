There are lots of "laws" named after people, that describe common tropes/adages/idioms/sayings when it comes to the internet.

## Cunningham's Law

## Poe's Law
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law

# Murphy's Law books has basically all pre-internet adages
From this [VSauce Video](https://youtube.com/shorts/4vbdDtbgkr8?si=Y6g8q9Zgg30PrVti) he talks about [Arthur Bloch's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Bloch) book Murphy's Law published 1977

But the different editions of the book have been confusing me, so summarized:
## "Murphy's Law and Other Reasons Why Things Go Wrong"
- ISBN [9780843104288](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780843104288)
- Published 1978
- The original!
- Had a couple sequels
- Converted to HTML: https://www.cse.unr.edu/~sushil/class/cs202/quotes/cs202.html#laws ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20221204172700/https://www.cse.unr.edu/~sushil/class/cs202/quotes/cs202.html#laws))
	- Doesn't have entries from Book Two, Thee, Murphy's law 2000, or Computer Murphology from 9780843129687
- [x] Try to find from VSauce video: "Boob's law" is "You always find something the last place you look." --
	- it's not in the HTML, but presumably is in text of first book?
	- Another law from the VSauce is in the website: Meskimen's Laws \#2 "There's never time to do it right, but always time to do it over."
	- Boob's law is in "Murphy's law complete: all the reasons why everything goes wrong!" on p37
