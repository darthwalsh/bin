# Writing Style Guidelines

## Structure
- Lead with problem/context, then solutions
- Include "When do you need X?" sections
- End with "Gotchas" or edge cases

## Code Examples
- Show multiple approaches with trade-offs as subheadings
- Mark patterns: `❌` broken/discouraged, `✅` recommended
- Add inline warnings: `# ⚠️ OOPS! <explanation of what's wrong>`
- Show anti-patterns after, then explain WHY they fail
- Be specific about what breaks: "Could leak to next invocation" not "this is bad"

## Cross-references
- Use `[[WikiLink]]` syntax
- Compare across domains (languages, systems, etc.)
- Reference actual library code with links when possible

## Markdown Checklist Conventions

When working with markdown checklists:

### Task Status Markers
- `[ ]` - Not started / Pending / In progress
- `[x]` - Completed / Done
- `[-]` - Won't fix / Not applicable / Intentionally skipped

### Won't Fix Pattern
When marking a task as "won't fix", use this format:

```markdown
- [-] Check headers visible in logging
    - **WONTFIX**: Java service doesn't automatically capture HTTP request headers in logging without additional configuration/instrumentation
```

Always provide a clear and concise reason when using `[-]`
